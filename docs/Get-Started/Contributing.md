# Contributing

Ractive is a community-driven project. Most of its best features were [suggested by users like you](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aenhancement%20). There are a lot of ways you can contribute to the project. Here are a few examples:

## Contribute code

Raising issues, reporting bugs, feature requests, enhancements, optimizations, all forms of contributions welcome! . Just go over the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) and select your course of action.

## Write documentation

If you've spotted a typo, a section you can explain better, or if you're just better in The Queen's English than we are, your help is greatly appreciated. Each page in the documentation is just [a file written in markdown](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractivejs.github.io/tree/dev/docs). All you need is a text editor to get started.

## Write plugins

Extend Ractive in ways you've never seen before. Interface with other libraries, create effects, widgets, interactions, custom elements, and so much more with Ractive's very extensible core.

Refer to [Plugins](../Integrations/Plugins.md) for details on how to start writing Ractive plugins.

## Build stuff

But above all, build stuff! If you make something with Ractive, we'd love to hear about it.
