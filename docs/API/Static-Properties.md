Ractive.defaults.delimiters = [ '[[', ']]' ];

// Future instances now use [[ ]]
ractive1 = new Ractive({
    template: 'hello [[world]]'
});
```

Configurations set on the instance override the ones present in `Ractive.defaults`.

```js
Ractive.defaults.delimiters = [ '[[', ']]' ];

// Uses the delimiters specified above
new Ractive({
	template: 'hello [[world]]'
});

// Uses the delimiters specified in the init options
new Ractive({
	template: 'hello //world\\',
	delimiters: [ '//', '\\' ]

var MyRactive = Ractive.extend();

MyRactive.defaults.el = document.body;
